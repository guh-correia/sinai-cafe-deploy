## About

**Sinai Cafe** is an order management system built specifically for a mobile event-based cafe â€” meaning there is no fixed location.  
The platform was designed to allow customers to place their own orders quickly and independently, which is essential during busy events where time and space are limited.

This project was developed as a freelance job using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **PHP**, and **Node.js**.

## How to Run

The front-end of the system is already live and can be accessed here:  
ðŸ”— [https://sinai-cafe.vercel.app/](https://sinai-cafe.vercel.app/)

> **Note:** The back-end server is not always online. It is only activated during events when the system is in use, so you probably wonâ€™t be able to complete an order outside of those times.

## How to Use

**Sinai Cafe** was primarily designed to run on tablets.  
If you're using a device with a smaller screen, you may encounter some responsiveness issues.

Despite that, the system is highly intuitive and was built with simplicity in mind to ensure a smooth experience for customers. Hereâ€™s how to place an order:

1. Go to the home page.
2. Select a drink (e.g., a coffee).
3. Choose your type of milk.
4. Select any optional add-ons (this step is not mandatory).
5. Review your order on the next page.
6. Enter your name and submit the order.

After submitting, you should see a confirmation message saying your order was received and that youâ€™ll be called by name. The system then returns to the home page automatically.

## Order Management

The team uses a separate dashboard to manage orders.  
This dashboard continuously communicates with an API to check for new incoming orders in real time.

> Access to the management dashboard is private and not included in this repository for security reasons.
